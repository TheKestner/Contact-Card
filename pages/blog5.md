## Week 2  

* **What is one thing you would like to learn more about regarding JavaScript (JSON, Data Structures), Bootstrap, or Atomic Design?**

    I would most likely want to learn more about JSON. Having the option to store your data via another file to access it seems very useful and possibly even a best practice. 

* **How does In-Person Bootcamp compare to Remote Onboarding?**

    The experience so far has been very exciting and nice to meet everyone, including the second remote group that we did not get to interact with. It is harder to get a feel from short interactions via Remote Onboarding compared to spending basically a full work week of time with others via In-Person. It's always nice to get to do stuff on your own time from your home, but I glad that this experience will be In-Person. I look forward to sharing this journey with my fellow Bootcampers. 

* **What is your “Why”?**

    The easy answer to this question would be to be able to get a Job. Which I believe is the Ultimate goal of just about everyone in this bootcamp. If I was to really think as to why this type of Job or why quit my Job to take a chance on this? I believe it comes from my interest in Technology. I've been interested in anything technology related as long as I can remember. Having a Career path in Technology and to build things is something that I've wanted for a long time. Which isn't something I had the opportunity to do while I lived in Eastern Kentucky. My options for a career path was extremely limited, but eventually lead to me here.
