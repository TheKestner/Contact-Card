        Hey! This section is all about ME! Thanks for taking the time to take a look. My name is Zachary Kestner and I live in Lexington, KY but I come from Eastern Kentucky. As beautiful the Appalachian mountains can be, the opportunities are very lacking. So I am very grateful for where I am currently within my life. I have a love for technology and been interested for most of my life. Before starting the bootcamp, mainly my experience with technology has been hardware related. I've built my own computer and a few others as a hobby which eventually lead me to pursue Web Development. I am on a Journey to become a Web Developer via the Awesome Inc, Bootcamp. Feel free to keep an eye out on my journey as I progress through the bootcamp and even once I hopefully become a Web Developer!
