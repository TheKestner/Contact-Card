## Week 8

* **What have you learned about CLIs? Do you think they are scary?**
Command line interface or Terminal is something that I would have avoided before starting this bootcamp. Mainly because from previous experience of people causing issues with their computers by using it incorrectly. Command Line interface is no longer this scary black box that I am afraid of using on my computer. It is actually very helpful to quickly get things saved and pushed to github from gitpod(IDE). It also allows you to easily run programs or added packages to your project as well. The options with it seem limitless compared to our initial routine of git add/commit/push at the start of the bootcamp. 

* **If you were to build a CLI, what would it do?**

If I were to build a CLI, then I would build something that would improve performance or something that would perform a task that normally takes longer without it. 


* **List some ideas that without a Framework, would take you a long time to code**
