## Week 9

* **What have you learned about CLIs? Do you think they are scary?**
Command line interface or Terminal is something that I would have avoided before starting this bootcamp. Mainly because from previous experience of people causing issues with their computers by using it incorrectly. Command Line interface is no longer this scary black box that I am afraid of using on my computer. It is actually very helpful to quickly get things saved and pushed to github from gitpod(IDE). It also allows you to easily run programs or added packages to your project as well. The options with it seem limitless compared to our initial routine of git add/commit/push at the start of the bootcamp. 

* **If you were to build a CLI, what would it do?**

If I were to build a CLI, then I would build something that would improve performance or something that would perform a task that is being used very often. Anything that helps improve or speeds up the ability to work. 


* **List some ideas that without a Framework, would take you a long time to code**
    In relation to using both Bootstrap and React with recent projects. There is most likely a lot that could be listed here since they both provide so many different things that may have taken longer to type without. Bootstrap for instance provides you with a lot of front-end components which can even be used in React still. For example, you can easily get a ready to go navbar without having to get it ready from scratch. Take that navbar and even use it as a reuseable component within react via multiple pages. Which could save you plenty of time of needing to produce similar code on different pages. On the react side, you can route different pages fairly quickly with very little code.
