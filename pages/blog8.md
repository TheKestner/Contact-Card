* **Do you think JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries are easy or hard to use?**
 I imagine it could vary based on the Framework/Library that you are trying to use. Although using React, it seems like an easy way to write both Javascript and HTML together in a clean and a component base structure. It would be intresting to learn if any other Framework or Libraries are harder to implement, if so then why. 



* **What Frameworks or Libraries are you interested in learning more about?**
Anime.js seems like an intresting library to look into because the name peaked my intrest mostly. Although it looks like it could even be pretty useful with adding animation to a site. Framework wise, I would like to learn more into Node.js since it is something that I have seen around the web a bit but don't fully understand what it does currently. 




* **Find one emerging JavaScript tool that you would like to learn more about or use in your final project.**
One javascript tool that I would like to dive deepr into or even use would be Parcel. It seems to provide a lot of usefulness during building and after. Mainly intrested in what it can do optimization wise for your build and how excatly it does that automatically.
