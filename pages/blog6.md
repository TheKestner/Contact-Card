## Week 6 

* **What did you learn about that helped you understand the development process?**
 The introduction of API's and the use of data within an website/app that we created helped me understand that you have a lot of different working parts to an overall whole product. 


* **What does it mean to develop good code?**
 I belive that good code is easily readable and clean. It should have good naming for your future self/other developers that needs to read your code. The last thing you want is either your or someone else to comeback to your code in the future and being unable to read any of it. At that point, you may have to put more work into something that should have been clear in the first place.

* **What does it mean to be a good developer?**
Someone that is always improving and learning while also writing code to be clean/readable for themself and others. As a developer you want to constantly be learning since the field seems to be constantly changing. 

* **What is one thing that programmers hate doing?**

WET code - Write Everything Twice, unless you enjoy typing. For the most part is seems to be best practice to keep your code DRY - Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself. Mainly it can reduce your chance for errors as well.
