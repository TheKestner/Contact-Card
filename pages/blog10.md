## Week 10

* **Now that you are halfway through bootcamp, what has been the biggest hurdle that you have gone past? What do you think is going to be the next biggest thing to power through?**
My biggest hurdle that I was able to make past was knowing when to ask for help. After attempting to figure something out after a long period of time, I've learned to use the resources around me to get a better understanding. I have a culture ingrained in me that in a professional setting that asking for help means that you are not good enough. Being in an environment that allows you to fail and actually doing so to improve has really improved upon on how I learn and how much I learn as a person. My next biggest hurdles I believe is becoming fully Independent to be able to handle any task that is thrown at me and at the rate at which I am able to complete these tasks. Which I believe will come with time and practice.

* **Compared to earlier, what are three ideas you might want to do for your final project? Are they the same ideas as before, or have they changed now that you understand more about the technology and your limitations?**
I believe that my ideas are changing or maybe just growing as I learn more throughout the bootcamp. There are multiple different websites I could build, games could even be an option now, or maybe something that is both Front-end and Back-end related. We have just touched the surface of back-end. Which would make me lean more towards like a website currently. Although I have to take into account my limitations and not try to focus on making a dream project or maybe even a game would be too much currently for me. I guess we will see in due time. 


* **What surprised you about your first week in Python and how was it different from your first week in JavaScript?**
I was surprised at how clean and easy to read that python can sometimes be. You have to be very aware of your spacin, but your IDE does a decent job of making it clear if there is an issue. I also much prefer the use of Self in Python vs. This in Javascript. I would say that some concepts that carried over did make it a lot easier to pick up due to already having experience with Javascript. I think starting over or learning something new is always a challenge, but this time I didn't feel like I was starting from nothing.
