* **What are some similarities and differences you can see with JS and Python?**
You start to really see how similar coding is across different languages after making the jump from the first language you learn. Javascript and Python are both object-oriented languages while Python is geared toward back-end and Javascript is mainly geared toward Front-end. The difference that I actually ended up enjoying was the way Python defines code blocks vs. Javscript curly braces to group. Switching to just needing to have the blocks indented to be much easier to read. Although it may have been easier to grasp because of already spending so much time with Javascript. Which both languages have either a List or Array to store values, but Python additionally has Tuples which is very similar to lists but immutable.  

* **If you had started with Python instead of JS, how do you think the Bootcamp would be different? Would you have benefited?**
I feel like starting with the front-end and working on the back-end is the right way to go with learning since it allows you to visually see how web-development works visually and then what is behind the curtains. This type of what if is hard to answer because honestly, it could go either way depending on the person. I think it would be different because we would have to work backwards from the back-end and connect it to the front-end which may be more jarring when learning together within the boot camp. Although having any coding experience prior would always be a bonus regardless of the language, but I think JS to Python was the way to go. Personally, I'm starting to find myself leaning more back-end oriented but have enjoyed it all. I feel like either way the benefits of switching the order would still come with their own challenges as well. 


* **Find one API, NPM package, Library, and/or Framework you think you might want to use for your final project.**
I've been looking around at some different APIs that could be interesting to use for a Final Project. Haven't really settled on a single one, but some interesting gaming APIs that allow you to display data from an account you search. Which there are plenty of sites that do this already, but would be cool to make one that I could use for a Multiplayer game that I enjoy.
